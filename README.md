## Description
Make a Vehicle Take a Vehicle is a command line interface program that allows a user to add a vehicle to or select a vehicle from a list of vehicles, with the options being cars, trucks, and motorbikes. The user can then model the performance of specified actions with those vehicles. The actions include basic functions like starting, increasing or decreasing speed, turning right or left, and stopping. More sophisticated actions are limited to the type of vehicle chosen from the list of vehicles, such as towing vehicles or performing wheelies.

MVP

Future features are currently limited, but this framework could be the bases for a CLI video game like they had back in the 80s
